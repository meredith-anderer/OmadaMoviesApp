## Architecture Overview

The application follows a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Directory Structure
- **Views**: Contains all SwiftUI views, following a component-based architecture
- **ViewModels**: Houses the business logic and state management
- **Models**: Contains data models and domain entities
- **Networking**: Implements the networking layer with clear separation of concerns

### Key Design Decisions

1. **MVVM Architecture**
   - Clear separation between Views and ViewModels
   - ViewModels handle business logic and state management
   - Views are purely declarative and focused on UI representation
   - Proper task management for concurrent operations

2. **Clean Networking Layer**
   - Abstracted network calls through a dedicated service layer
   - Clear separation between API endpoints and network execution
   - Protocol-oriented design for better testability
   - Adapter pattern for movie search functionality
   - Proper error handling and task cancellation

3. **State Management**
   - Direct property-based state management for better performance
   - Comprehensive error handling with distinct states for search and pagination
   - Efficient pagination with proper task lifecycle management
   - Debounced search for better UX

4. **UI/UX Considerations**
   - Responsive search interface with 300ms debounce
   - Lazy loading of content for better performance
   - Clear error states with retry functionality
   - Smooth navigation between views
   - Reusable components like SearchBar and error views
  
## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Testing
- Add unit tests for ViewModels
- Implement UI tests for critical user flows
- Add network layer tests with mock responses
- Include integration tests for key features

### 2. Code Organization
- Implement a proper design system with reusable components and consistent styling
- Create a dedicated UI components library
- Add comprehensive documentation for public interfaces
- Consider using Swift Package Manager for modularization

### 3. Architecture and State Management
- Add a proper caching layer for offline support
- Add proper logging and analytics infrastructure
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed network requests
- Add request throttling and rate limiting
- Move view-specific presentation logic from view into ViewModel/ dedicated ViewState types
- Consider using a state container (like Redux/TCA) for more complex state management

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Implement dark mode support
- Add animations for state transitions
- Improve accessibility support
- Add localization support
- Add pull-to-refresh functionality
- Implement search filters and sorting options

### 5. Performance
- Implement image caching
- Add proper memory management for large lists
- Implement request batching for concurrent API calls
- Add response compression
